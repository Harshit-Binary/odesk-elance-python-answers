Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

Example
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
order,hello,would,test
Then, the output should be:
hello,order,test,would
Note: You should assume that input to the program is from console input (raw_input)"""


y=raw_input("enter words, comma separated> ")
y=y.split(",")
y=sorted(y)
print ",".join(y)
